Charges are based on bookings. ALL BOOKINGS MUST BE PAID FOR. We are unable to deduct money or make refunds if the child does not attend.

Standing Orders must be set up before the child starts. The first week's fees must be paid with registration, to allow time for the standing order to be set up.

Fees coming in to PLAYPALS must be paid promptly and must remain the same every month to cover wages, running expenses and food.

WE ARE UNABLE TO DEDUCT OR REFUND MONEY WHEN CHILDREN ARE AWAY ILL OR ON HOLIDAY.

A registration fee of £25 is charged. Also the first month's fee is paid on registration. These are non-returnable.

When a child is leaving, one month's written notice must be given, or a month's fees paid.
